The purpose is to bootstrapping our application and its dependencies. Administrators need a way to deploy argoCD applications using argoCD itself. The solution is to create an application made up of other argoCD applications.\nFor example, we have an application that has dependencies on:\nCert-Manager Backend Application Ingress Frontend Application etc\u0026hellip; Instead of deploying a bunch of argoCD applications individually, we could deploy one argoCD application that deploys other application.\nThis is very convenient because it provides an entry point and bootstraps dependencies before the main application goes online.\nSyncWaves and Resource Hooks SyncWaves and resource hooks are a way we can order how argoCD applies individual manifests to allocation resources on k8s cluster. We use annotation (not labels) to annotate the object with the order we\u0026rsquo;d like to apply the manifest, number based with lowest going first. For example, we have a Deployment numbered as 0 and a Service as 1, argoCD will apply the Deployment first, waiting for it to report healthy, then apply the Service\ntest 2 test 3 test 4 "},{"uri":"https://squoc.github.io/getting-started/what-is-gitops/","title":"What Is Gitops?","tags":[],"description":"","content":"lorem isump\n"},{"uri":"https://squoc.github.io/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://squoc.github.io/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
